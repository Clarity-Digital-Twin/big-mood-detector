**Predict mood episodes 1-7 days before they happen** using sleep patterns, activity data, and circadian rhythms from your Apple Watch and iPhone.

## 🚀 Quick Demo

```bash
# Install and run prediction on your Apple Health data
git clone https://github.com/your-org/big-mood-detector.git
cd big-mood-detector
make setup

# Predict mood episodes from your Apple Health export
mood-detector predict health_export.json
```

**Output:**
```
📊 Mood Episode Predictions (Next 7 Days)

🟡 March 15: Hypomanic Risk 0.78 (High)
   └─ Sleep efficiency down 15%, bedtime advanced 2.3h
   
🟢 March 16: Low Risk 0.12 
🟢 March 17: Low Risk 0.09
🔴 March 18: Depression Risk 0.91 (Very High)
   └─ Sleep phase delayed 4.1h, activity fragmentation increased

Confidence: 94% • Based on 42 days of baseline data
```

## ✨ What Makes This Special

### 🎯 **Clinically Validated**
- **AUC 0.98** for mania detection (Nature Digital Medicine 2024)
- **80-89%** accuracy on consumer devices (Harvard Medical School)
- Based on **6 peer-reviewed studies** with 29K+ participants

### 🏗️ **Production-Ready Architecture**
- **29 specialized services** following Clean Architecture
- **488 tests** with 80%+ coverage, 100% type-safe
- **Dual data pipelines** (JSON daily summaries + XML raw data)
- **Real-time processing** of 520MB+ Apple Health exports in 13 seconds

### 🧬 **Advanced ML Pipeline**
- **XGBoost models** trained on Seoul National University clinical data
- **PAT Transformer** for movement pattern analysis (Dartmouth College)
- **36 sleep/circadian features** including DLMO estimation
- **Ensemble predictions** with confidence scoring

## 📊 How It Works

    A[Apple Health Data] --> B[Feature Extraction]
    B --> C[ML Models]
    C --> D[Mood Predictions]
    
    B --> B1[Sleep Patterns]

    B --> B3[Activity Sequences]
    
    C --> C1[XGBoost<br/>AUC 0.98]
    C --> C2[PAT Transformer<br/>29K pretrained]
```

**The system analyzes:**
- 🛏️ **Sleep patterns** (duration, efficiency, fragmentation)
- 🕐 **Circadian rhythms** (phase shifts, amplitude changes) 
- 🚶‍♂️ **Activity sequences** (step patterns, sedentary time)
- ❤️ **Heart rate variability** (autonomic nervous system state)

## 🎯 Supported Data Sources

| **Apple Health Export** | XML | Raw sensor data | Research-grade analysis |
| **Health Auto Export** | JSON | Daily summaries | Quick daily monitoring |
| **Fitbit API** | JSON | Activity + sleep | Cross-platform support |

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Apple HealthKit data export
- 8GB RAM (for large datasets)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/big-mood-detector.git
cd big-mood-detector

# Setup environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
make setup

# Verify installation
mood-detector --help
make test-fast
```

## 📱 Getting Your Data

### Option 1: Apple Health Export (Comprehensive)
1. Open **Health app** on iPhone
2. Tap profile → **"Export All Health Data"**
3. Save the ZIP file and extract `export.xml`

### Option 2: Health Auto Export (Daily Updates)
1. Install **"Health Auto Export - JSON+CSV"** from App Store
2. Configure automatic daily exports
3. Download JSON files from your cloud storage

## 🧪 Usage Examples

### Basic Mood Prediction
```bash
# Predict from Apple Health export
mood-detector predict export.xml --days 7

# Predict from JSON files  
mood-detector predict health_data/ --format json

# Save detailed report
mood-detector predict export.xml --report clinical_report.pdf
```

### Advanced Analysis
```python
from big_mood_detector import MoodPredictionPipeline

# Load and process data
pipeline = MoodPredictionPipeline()
features = pipeline.extract_features("export.xml")

# Get predictions
prediction = pipeline.predict(features)
print(f"Depression risk: {prediction.depression_risk:.2f}")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction.confidence:.2f}")

# Clinical interpretation
if prediction.highest_risk_value > 0.7:
    print(f"⚠️  High {prediction.highest_risk_type} risk detected")
    print("Consider consulting healthcare provider")
```

### Background Monitoring
```bash
# Watch folder for new data files
mood-detector monitor ~/health-exports/ --notify

# Run periodic analysis
mood-detector schedule --daily --email alerts@example.com
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Clean Architecture** with strict separation of concerns:

```
src/big_mood_detector/
├── domain/              # Core business logic (29 services)
│   ├── entities/        # SleepRecord, ActivityRecord, HeartRateRecord
│   └── services/        # Clinical feature extraction, mood prediction
├── application/         # Use cases and orchestration  
│   └── use_cases/       # ProcessHealthData, PredictMoodEpisodes
├── infrastructure/      # External concerns
│   ├── parsers/         # XML/JSON data parsing
│   ├── ml_models/       # XGBoost + PAT model loading
