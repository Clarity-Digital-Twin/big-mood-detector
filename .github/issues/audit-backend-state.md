# Audit Backend State and Plan Next Steps

## Current State Summary

### âœ… Completed
- Core infrastructure migration (exceptions, config, dependencies)
- API integration test suite created
- All unit tests passing (700+)
- Repository pattern fully implemented
- PAT model pollution fixed with proper test isolation

### ðŸ”§ In Progress
- API integration tests partially passing (predictions work, labels have issues)
- API response codes need fixes (returning 200 instead of 201 for POST)
- Test database isolation needed for label tests

### ðŸ“‹ Pending High Priority
1. **Label CLI Implementation** - Critical for getting real labeled data
2. **API Response Code Fixes** - Ensure proper HTTP status codes
3. **Environment Configuration** - Move hardcoded paths to settings
4. **Test Database Isolation** - Prevent test pollution

## Next Sprint Priorities

1. **Fix API Issues** (Day 1)
   - Correct HTTP status codes (201 for POST, 204 for DELETE)
   - Add proper test database cleanup between tests
   - Implement date validation for episode creation

2. **Label CLI MVP** (Days 2-3)
   - TDD implementation following the design doc
   - Interactive mode with HIG compliance
   - CSV export for model training
   - Integration with existing EpisodeLabeler

3. **Infrastructure Improvements** (Day 4)
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Docker setup for deployment
   - GitHub Actions CI improvements

## Questions to Consider

- Should we implement the label CLI before fixing all API issues?
- Do we need a separate test database configuration?
- Should we add integration tests for the CLI commands?

@claude Please analyze our current state and provide recommendations on:
1. The optimal order for tackling these tasks
2. Any missing critical items we should address
3. Specific implementation approaches for the Label CLI
