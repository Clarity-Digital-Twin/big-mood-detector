This document contains specific instructions and context for the backend AI agent responsible for developing, debugging, and optimizing the repository codebase.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

Your primary goal is to:

1. **Write clean, maintainable, and test-driven code**.
2. **Adhere strictly to the provided Clean Architecture**.
3. **Optimize performance for large datasets** (multi-GB scale).
4. **Ensure clinical accuracy** aligned with DSM-5 and referenced peer-reviewed studies.

## 🚀 Paste-and-Run Development Commands

Use these commands verbatim to streamline your workflow:

### 🛠 Initial Setup & Development

```bash
# One-time setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Always activate first!
make setup                 # or: pip install -e ".[dev,ml,monitoring]"

# Daily workflow
source .venv/bin/activate  # Start of each session
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
make dev                   # Start development server
```

### ✅ Testing & Validation

```bash
# TDD workflow
make test-watch            # Auto-run tests on changes
pytest tests/unit/domain/test_<feature>.py -v  # Specific test

# Test categories
make test-fast             # Unit tests only (695 tests)
make test-ml               # ML model validation
pytest -m clinical        # Clinical tests only
pytest -m "not large"     # Skip large file tests
```

### 🧹 Code Quality

```bash
make quality               # Full check: lint + type + test
make format                # Auto-format with black
make lint                  # Ruff linting
make type-check            # MyPy type safety
```

### 💾 Database Operations

```bash
make db-upgrade            # Apply migrations
make db-reset              # Reset to clean state
alembic revision -m "description"  # New migration
```

## 📐 Architectural Guidelines

Respect the strict boundaries defined by Clean Architecture:

```

* **Dependency Direction**: Interfaces → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure
* **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access in domain, implement in infrastructure
* **Factory Pattern**: Parser creation based on file type
* **Value Objects**: Immutable (frozen dataclasses) for thread safety

## 🗃 Data Pipeline & ML Guidance

### Processing Steps

1. **Input**: 
   - XML: `apple_export/export.xml` (520MB+, use streaming)
   - JSON: `health_auto_export/*.json` (smaller, direct parse)

2. **Parsing**: 
   - XML: `StreamingXMLParser` for memory efficiency
   - JSON: Direct parsing for Health Auto Export

3. **Aggregation**:
   - `SleepWindowAnalyzer`: Merge episodes within 3.75h
   - `ActivitySequenceExtractor`: Minute-level sequences (1440 points/day)
   - Daily summaries by domain aggregators

4. **Feature Engineering** (36 features):
   - Basic: sleep duration, efficiency, timing
   - Advanced: PAT, circadian metrics (IS, IV, RA, L5/M10)
   - Clinical: short/long sleep windows, fragmentation

5. **Prediction**:
   - XGBoost: Primary model (AUC 0.80-0.98)
   - PAT Transformer: Ensemble member
   - Threshold: Clinical cutoffs per DSM-5

### Key Implementation Status

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

1. **TDD Red-Green-Refactor**:
   ```python
   # 1. Write failing test
   def test_new_feature():
       assert expected == actual  # FAIL
   
   # 2. Implement minimum to pass
   # 3. Refactor for clean code
   ```

2. **Test Pyramid**:
   - 695 unit tests (domain logic) ✅
   - Integration tests (parsers, DB) ✅
   - E2E tests (full pipeline) ✅

3. **Clinical Validation**:
   - Test against known patterns ✅
   - Validate thresholds from papers ✅
   - Edge cases (missing data, outliers) ✅

## 📊 Performance Targets

**✅ ALL TARGETS MET:**
- XML parsing: < 100MB RAM for any file size ✅
- Processing rate: > 50,000 records/second ✅
- Daily aggregation: < 1 second per year of data ✅
- ML inference: < 100ms per prediction ✅
- API response: < 200ms for feature extraction ✅

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

```bash
# Memory profiling
mprof run python scripts/process_large_xml.py
mprof plot

# Line profiling
kernprof -l -v scripts/bottleneck_script.py

# SQL query analysis
export SQLALCHEMY_ECHO=true

# Structured logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
