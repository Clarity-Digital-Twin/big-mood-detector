## 🚨 High Priority Refactoring Candidates

### **Domain Layer Issues**
1. **`clinical_interpreter.py`** (928 lines!) - ✅ You're already tackling this
2. **`sleep_aggregator.py`** - Likely doing too much if it handles all sleep logic
3. **`activity_aggregator.py`** - Same concern as sleep aggregator

### **Infrastructure Layer Red Flags**
4. **XML/JSON Parsers** - These often become monolithic:
   - `src/big_mood_detector/infrastructure/parsers/xml_parser.py`
   - `src/big_mood_detector/infrastructure/parsers/json_parser.py`
   - Pattern violation: Likely mixing parsing + validation + transformation

5. **ML Model Files** - Complex ML code often violates SRP:
   - `pat_loader_direct.py` (already showing complexity in your recent fixes)
   - `ensemble_orchestrator.py` 
   - Any XGBoost model files

6. **Repository Implementations** - Often become data access swiss army knives

### **API/Interface Layer Suspects**
7. **Route Files** - FastAPI routes often accumulate business logic:
   - `clinical_routes.py` 
   - Any routes with >100 lines
   - Routes doing validation + business logic + response formatting

## 🔍 Specific Code Smells to Look For

### **Line Count Red Flags**
```bash
# Run this to find large files
find src/ -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n | tail -10
```

### **Complexity Indicators**
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Methods with >10 branches
- **Parameter Count**: Functions with >5 parameters
- **Nested Conditionals**: >3 levels deep
- **Long Method Names**: Usually indicate doing too much

### **SOLID Violations**
- **SRP**: Classes doing parsing AND validation AND transformation
- **OCP**: Hard-coded configurations instead of strategy patterns
- **DIP**: Concrete dependencies instead of abstractions

## 📋 Systematic Refactoring Checklist

### **Phase 1: Domain Services** (Current)
- ✅ `ClinicalInterpreter` → `EpisodeInterpreter` + `BiomarkerInterpreter` + `TreatmentRecommender`

### **Phase 2: Infrastructure Concerns**
```python
# Likely needed patterns:
# - Strategy Pattern for different parsers
# - Factory Pattern for model loading
# - Adapter Pattern for external APIs
# - Repository Pattern cleanup
```

### **Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns**
```python
# Missing patterns that should be added:
# - Observer Pattern for audit logging
# - Decorator Pattern for validation
# - Chain of Responsibility for processing pipelines
```

## 🎯 Quick Assessment Strategy

Run these commands to identify problem files:

```bash
# Find large files
find src/ -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '$1 > 200 {print $0}' | sort -n

# Find complex functions (lots of 'if' statements)
grep -r "if.*:" src/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

# Find classes with many methods
grep -r "def " src/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
```

## 🚩 Red Flag Patterns I'd Expect to Find

1. **God Classes**: Files doing parsing + validation + business logic + persistence
2. **Feature Envy**: Domain objects reaching into infrastructure 
3. **Shotgun Surgery**: Changes requiring edits across many files
4. **Primitive Obsession**: Using strings/dicts instead of value objects
5. **Long Parameter Lists**: Instead of configuration objects

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Continue your current refactor** but keep a "Technical Debt Backlog":

1. **Finish ClinicalInterpreter split** (you're making excellent progress)
2. **Add regulatory logging** (critical path)
3. **Then tackle the biggest files** revealed by the line count analysis
4. **Apply patterns systematically** (Strategy for parsers, Factory for models, etc.)
