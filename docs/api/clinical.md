## Clinical Guidelines

All interpretations follow:
- **DSM-5-TR** criteria for mood episodes
- **PHQ-9** validated scoring for depression
- **ASRM/YMRS** validated scoring for mania/hypomania
- Evidence-based digital biomarker thresholds from peer-reviewed research

## Risk Levels

- **Low**: Minimal symptoms, no immediate concern
- **Moderate**: Clinical symptoms present, monitoring recommended
- **High**: Significant symptoms, clinical evaluation needed
- **Critical**: Severe symptoms or safety concerns, urgent care required
