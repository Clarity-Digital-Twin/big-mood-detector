## Key Themes for Clinical Interpretation Layer

1. **Clinical Cutoffs**: PHQ-8 ≥ 10 for depression, ASRM ≥ 6 for hypomania/mania
2. **Risk Stratification**: Early warning signs, prodromal symptoms, rapid cycling detection
3. **Personalization**: Individual baselines, demographic factors, treatment history
4. **Mixed States**: Complex presentations requiring nuanced interpretation
5. **Circadian Markers**: DLMO, sleep timing, activity patterns as clinical indicators
6. **Implementation Ethics**: Privacy, consent, clinical workflow integration
7. **Validation Requirements**: Sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values
8. **Clinical Actions**: When to alert clinicians, patient communication, intervention thresholds
